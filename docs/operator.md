## General notes for operator
Hello intrepid WORM arcade operator. Welcome to the 80s..

Turn them on by finding the switch!! Seen from the front: Mortal Kombat has its switch on the top of the machine left, super off road has it on its back top-right, while hotrod has its switch on the back bottom-right.

All machines have a coin-mechanism, coin, and back-panel lock. These are opened by the keys that have (in the same order) the small "coin" washer, big "coin" washer, and no-coin-washer attached to it.

--To recap--
* Coin-mechanism door: keys with small washer on it
* Coin-deposit door: keys with big washer on it
* Back panel: keys with no washer on it

All machines generally have a control behind the coin-mechanism door to operate volume. All manuals for each machine and cabinet can be found the [github repository](https://github.com/wakass/wormarcade)
