## Notes

TTL Logic level of K7000 is 5V, see "Raster Monitor Lesson"

To convert VGA Tester with seperate H and V Sync to RGB+Composite sync use circuit from:
[link](https://www.epanorama.net/circuits/vga2rgbs.html)
Obviously a simple logic circuit.

First stage consists of two [edge to glitch converter](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/270894/dual-edge-detector). Leading edges become pulses which trigger the next XOR stage..


### Super off road
#### Pedals
5k Potentiometers. In-situ adjustment of potentiometers in diagnostics menu to get right setup. Min 0-128, max 255. One pedal was out of alignment so to speak. Needed some adjustment of minimum to be able to get to 255.


#### Wheels

Optocouplers, simple..efficient. Can sense direction and speed.

#### Buttons, Spring-levers

Spring levers had 90degrees oriented wedges to always make optimum contact. This opposed to cherry switches, which seems to have just a little dot/bump. Also the metal of the wedges seemed to be of a different material to the spring-lever itself. Probably corrosion proof since most of the levers were corroded but the contacts still worked fine.


### MK
#### Cherry switches
Amazing little guys, spring-loaded cantilevers. Moderately servicable by taking of the little red knobs, opening up and doing some cleaning.
