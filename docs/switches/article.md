## Cherry switches

Illustrious and most known for their MX variants, high dependability microswitches in keyboards. Less known, except in Arcade Communities is the D4 series of their switches. Spring-loaded microswitches. Let's dive in a little and see what can be found.

### Variants in tension, travel, lever-arm


### Contact metallurgy
Tbh my fascination goes a little more into the contact point. They've engineered a little dot on the top of the "leaf-spring" where the coloration is also slightly different. You'd want to avoid oxidation as long as possible, so your materials needs to be very nice.

Let's zoom in..

This is reminiscent of the leaf-springs I found in the other arcade, 


### Leaf spring

Considerations of tip pressure to contact. Might need significant debounce. Constant pressure switch alleviate this and provide a more, naturally debounced signal. Easier for electronics, presumably.
